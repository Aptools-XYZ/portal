                  contacting APTOOLS at community@aptools.xyz to notify APTOOLS
                  of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, APTOOLS will

                  any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim we may

                  party (the "Notified Party") to understand the basis of and
                  evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds

                  Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith

                  You and APTOOLS agree that the American Arbitration
                  Association ("_ AAA ") will administer the arbitration under
                  its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
                  Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes in effect at the time
                  arbitration is sought ("AAA Rules"). Those rules are available
                  at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A
                  party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the
                  other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified
                  in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for
                  Arbitration.) Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis
                  and will be handled by a sole arbitrator. The single
                  arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney
                  licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties
                  from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are
                  unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days
                  of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will
                  appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The
                  arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies,
                  including injunctive relief, that would be available to you
                  hereunder in an individual lawsuit. Notwithstanding any
                  language to the contrary in this paragraph, if a party seeks
                  injunctive relief that would significantly impact other
                  APTOOLS users as reasonably determined by either party, the
                  parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an
                  individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3)
                  arbitrators. Each party shall select one arbitrator, and the
                  two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who
                  shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson
                  shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice
                  law and with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In
                  the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a
                  three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator
                  appointed in accordance with this Section shall make that
                  determination. If the arbitrator determines a three-person
                  panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if selected by
                  either party or as the chair by the two party-selected
                  arbitrators – participate in the arbitral panel. Except as and
                  to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the
                  arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

                  You and APTOOLS further agree that the arbitration will be

                  if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted via
                  videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic
                  means. If APTOOLS elects arbitration, APTOOLS shall pay all of
                  the AAA filing costs and administrative fees (other than
                  hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and
                  administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in
                  accordance with the AAA Rules, or in accordance with
                  countervailing law if contrary to the AAA Rules. However, if
                  the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your
                  request, APTOOLS will pay all filing, administration, and
                  arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the
                  arbitrator(s) finds that either the substance of your claim or
                  the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper
                  purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
                  Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees
                  will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Each
                  party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees,
                  except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.

                  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU
                  NOR APTOOLS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR
                  COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR
                  ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A
                  REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER
                  OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN
                  CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL
                  SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED.
                  Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity
                  of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the
                  arbitrator.

                  Notwithstanding your and APTOOLS's agreement to arbitrate
                  Disputes, either you or APTOOLS retain the following rights:
                </p>
                <p className="pt-[16px]">
                  You and APTOOLS retain the right (A) to bring an individual
                  action in small claims process in the courts of your Country
                  of Residence; and (B) to seek provisional relief in aid of
                  arbitration in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
                  the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
                  violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
                  patents or other intellectual property rights. Further, this
                  agreement to arbitrate does not deprive you of the protection
                  of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in
                  your Country of Residence; you shall retain any such rights
                  and this agreement to arbitrate shall be construed
                  accordingly.
                </p>
                <p className="pt-[16px]">
                  Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in
                  this Agreement, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate
                  is found not to apply to you or your Dispute, you and APTOOLS
                  agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a
                  court of competent jurisdiction in California, United States.
                  Both you and APTOOLS consent to venue and personal
                  jurisdiction there; provided that either party may seek
                  provisional relief in aid of arbitration to enforce its
                  intellectual property rights as provided above or bring an
                  action to confirm an arbitral award in any court having
                  jurisdiction.

                <p className="pt-[16px]">
                  This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or
                  expiration of this Agreement. With the exception of the
                  provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit
                  Collective Arbitration, if a court decides that any part of
                  this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then
                  the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall
                  nevertheless remain valid and in force. In the event that a
                  court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be
                  invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement
                  to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of this
                  Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and any
                  remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to the
                  preceding paragraph.
